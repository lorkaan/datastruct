# Data Structures in Python

This is an ever growing repository of abstracted data structures coded in Python.

It serves as a personal toolbox to be used across multiple projects.


## Structures

### Trees
- **AVL Tree**: A balanced binary search tree with customizable data
	- Customizable functionality to handle multiple keys, default enforce uniqueness.
	- relevant files: 
		- `bst/avlTree.py`

### Priority Queues
- Contains Max and Min **Heaps** with customizable data associated with a weight.
	- Min and Max are the same Heap implementation, simply with difference compare functions
	- relevant files:
		- `general/heap.py`

# Usage

If you wish to use this code, please check the license for legal uses of this code. 

I recommend that you look at the relevant files before integrating into any project.
While the code I provided here is useful, it is not designed to be used as blackbox.

# Future

There will be some Graph data structures coming soon.
